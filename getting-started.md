## Getting Started

### Install

To install Gravity, simply execute the commands given below. It should make two executables: the compiler itself and test runner.

```
git clone https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity.git
cd gravity
make
```

If you want to access the gravity compiler globally just add it to your PATH!

You can also use the Xcode project to create the gravity or unittest executables.
