## Introduction

**Gravity** is a powerful, dynamically typed, lightweight, embeddable programming language written in C without any external dependency (except stdlib). It is a class based concurrent scripting language with a modern Swift like syntax.

**Gravity** supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming and data-driven programming. Thanks to built-in special methods it can also be used as a prototype-based programming language.

**Gravity** has been developed from scratch for the Creo project in order to offer an easy way to write portable code for the iOS and Android platforms. It is written in portable C code that can be compiled in any platform using a C99 compiler. VM code is about 2K lines long, multipass compiler code is about 3K lines and shared code is about 2K lines. Compiler and virtual machine together add less than 200KB to the executable size in a 64bit system.
